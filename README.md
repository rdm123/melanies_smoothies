This repository is used for Snowflake lab works for Badge3(Data Application Builders Workshop)

Here I have created a streamlit app in snowflake, created databases and tables in snowflake. There are two streamlit apps in the workshop 
.Customize Smoothie Order
.Pending Smoothie Order

Here the script is for customize smoothie order. The app is also hosted in streamlit.io

Here is the link https://wcrkrndrnvyq9vf8koyexh.streamlit.app/

After customer placing the order from here the details will be transferred to Pending Smoothie oder app in snowflake.
After clicking the submit button there the order will be placed.
There is also an option available in Pending Smoothie Order app for re-filling the smoothie again, that data will also be sent.
